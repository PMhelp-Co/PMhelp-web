This repository is an import of the Webflow static export.

## Notes
- Static files (HTML/CSS/JS/images) are at the repository root.
- Deploy via Netlify (connect this repo to Netlify or use drag-and-drop).
- If you see broken assets on deployment, check for absolute paths (leading /) and case-sensitivity of filenames (Netlify/Linux is case-sensitive).
